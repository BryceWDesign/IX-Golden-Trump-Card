# Contributing to IX-Golden-Trump-Card 🃏

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **IX-Golden-Trump-Card 🃏** project. This repository is intended for public, peaceful, and scientifically accurate advancement of **real-world harmonic field resonance engineering**. This is not a theoretical or speculative project — all contributions must reflect that standard.

Please read and follow the guidelines below to ensure consistency, legal safety, and factual precision.

## 🚧 Contribution Scope

We welcome contributions in the following areas:
- Improved or alternative build configurations
- Signal waveform optimizations
- Experimental data or test validation results
- Accessibility improvements or field kit simplification
- Field effect visualization or material response documentation
- Non-commercial tool integrations or educational use cases

---

## 🚫 Not Permitted

The following contributions will be rejected or removed without exception:
- Theoretical pseudoscience, fictional physics, or metaphysical claims
- Militarization of the system in any form (e.g. EM weapon integration, targeting systems)
- Commercial rebranding, NFT packaging, resale-oriented forks
- Integration with closed-source surveillance, drone warfare, or defense platforms
- Unlicensed use of third-party content or violating GitHub terms of service

---

## 🧪 Scientific Integrity Standards

All technical contributions must:
- Be grounded in reproducible, real-world experimentation
- Include empirical observations, measurements, or well-documented testing procedures
- Avoid speculative language, exaggeration, or claims that cannot be physically verified
- Acknowledge limitations or incomplete results where applicable

This project holds to **laboratory-grade standards of integrity**, even in open-source format.

## 🛠️ Pull Request Instructions

1. Fork the repository  
2. Create a clearly named feature branch (e.g. `signal-adjustment-phase2`)  
3. Submit a pull request with a clear summary of:
   - What was changed
   - Why it was changed
   - How it was tested or verified

If proposing physical changes to the hardware layout, attach:
- Diagrams or annotated photos
- Pulse timing or waveform logic
- Material substitution specs (if applicable)

## 💡 Recognition and Attribution

All accepted contributors will be credited in the official `/validation/acknowledgments.md` file. Your name, alias, or organization will remain attached to your contributions unless explicitly requested otherwise.

---

## 🧭 Guiding Philosophy

This project is based on real engineering, real materials, and real science.

Every contribution should move the system forward toward:
- Greater reproducibility
- Greater accessibility
- Greater field stability
- And deeper understanding of resonance-based materials behavior

If your contribution meets that bar, it is welcome.
