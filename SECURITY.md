# Security & Acceptable Use – IX-Golden-Trump-Card 🃏

This document defines the acceptable security posture and usage boundaries for all deployments, forks, or reproductions of the **IX-Golden-Trump-Card 🃏** system.

This project is built on scientific transparency, peaceful intent, and open-source engineering. It is not theoretical. The device and its effects are real, reproducible, and accessible. Therefore, strict limitations apply to ensure this work is never used to harm, exploit, or deceive.

---

## ✅ Permitted Use

You may use, clone, or reproduce this project if you meet all of the following:

- You intend to use the device for peaceful, non-commercial, and non-weaponized purposes
- You are conducting **scientific, educational, or humanitarian experimentation**
- You are using all components in a lawful, responsible, and transparent manner
- You are not integrating this system into any covert or restricted-access hardware
- You are not violating local or international export control laws

This system is intended for open civilian research and EM field studies only.

## ❌ Strictly Prohibited Uses

The IX-Golden-Trump-Card 🃏 system may **not** be used, forked, modified, or deployed in any system or context involving:

- **Military application or integration**, including offensive or defensive field systems
- **Kinetic energy enhancement**, EM pulse weaponization, or directed energy discharge
- **Surveillance infrastructure**, drone telemetry, radar spoofing, or sensor deception
- **Psychological operations**, misinformation, or field-based interference with cognition or biology
- **High-frequency crowd control**, microwave denial, or thermal/agitation weaponry
- **Encrypted field cloaking** or phase-cancelled camouflage in covert environments

Any such use is a violation of the license, the contributor covenant, and the ethical core of this work.

## 🛡️ Suggested Implementation Controls

To ensure responsible deployment, users are strongly encouraged to implement:

- Physical access control to the harmonic assembly
- Environment logging during test or activation
- Peer-reviewed documentation of any experimental variations
- Use of non-metallic test enclosures to prevent unintentional propagation
- Independent observer validation when demonstrating anomalous EM behavior

This system is not inherently dangerous, but improper configurations may yield field behaviors that affect instrumentation, EM propagation, or sensitive electronics.

---

## 🔍 GitHub Monitoring

All forks and clones are publicly visible. If this project is observed being used in prohibited contexts or marketed as weaponizable hardware, the maintainer reserves the right to issue a public notice, revoke the license, or formally escalate the misuse to GitHub and/or relevant open-source defense oversight agencies.

---

## 🧠 Final Statement

This system does not harm, surveil, or deceive.  
It mimics gold-like behavior in foil using proven harmonic engineering principles.

Keep it open.  
Keep it honest.  
Keep it peaceful.
