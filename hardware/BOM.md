# 🧾 Bill of Materials – IX-Golden-Trump-Card 🃏

This document provides the complete and verified bill of materials (BOM) required to build the IX-Golden-Trump-Card 🃏 system. All components listed are commercially available, non-hazardous, non-restricted, and functionally aligned to real-world harmonic field resonance operation.

All measurements and tolerances are given with high-precision tolerances to maintain field fidelity.

## 🔩 Core Materials

| Item | Specification | Quantity | Notes |
|------|---------------|----------|-------|
| **Aluminum Foil Sheet** | 30.5cm × 30.5cm (1ft²), thickness 15–18μm | 1 | Household-grade Reynolds Wrap is acceptable; do not use non-stick variants |
| **24k Gold Wedding Band** | Size 9, solid 99.99% gold, uncoated | 1 | No engraving, no plating; must be pure 24k gold to enable field fidelity |
| **Silver + 24k Gold-Plated Alligator Clips (Small)** | Tip width ≤1.6mm (1/16 cm), silver core, 24k gold ≥5μm plated | 3 | Used to contact gold ring at equidistant points in triangular geometry |
| **Silver + 24k Gold-Plated Alligator Clips (Standard)** | Tip width ~1cm, silver core, 24k gold ≥5μm plated | 4 | Used at foil corners to clamp and optionally ground or float system |

## 🔌 Signal & Power Equipment

| Item | Specification | Quantity | Notes |
|------|---------------|----------|-------|
| **Function Generator** | Capable of 1Hz–10MHz, 3-channel output with phase offset | 1 | Required for driving the 3 ring contacts with 0°, 120°, 240° phase offset |
| **THz Waveform Generator (Optional)** | Tunable near 7.8 THz (Gold Debye frequency) | 1 (opt.) | Optional upgrade for direct phonon resonance injection; not required for visible field mimicry |
| **Pulse Driver Board (x3)** | TTL or analog logic gate driver, low voltage (~5V) | 3 | Used if separate hardware injection to clips is desired without function generator |
| **Power Supply (Low Voltage)** | 5V, regulated linear DC | 1 | For clip pulse system; clean power only — no high-frequency switching regulators |

## 🧱 Mechanical & Mounting

| Item | Specification | Quantity | Notes |
|------|---------------|----------|-------|
| **Non-Conductive Baseplate** | Acrylic, wood, or ceramic, 40cm² minimum | 1 | Mount foil on this to prevent field distortion; avoid metals or ferromagnetics |
| **Insulated Clip Leads** | Shielded if possible, 20–40cm | 7 | Connect function generator or pulse board to alligator clips without radiating noise |
| **Anti-static Gloves** | Nitrile, non-powdered | 1 pair | To handle foil and ring during assembly without charge introduction |
| **Precision Ruler or Calipers** | mm/cm | 1 | For spacing gold clip contacts at precise intervals (triangular geometry) |

## 📡 Optional Measurement Tools

| Item | Specification | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Digital Multimeter (DMM)** | With continuity and resistance modes | Confirm contact integrity during clip setup |
| **Thermal Imaging Camera (IR)** | >120×160 resolution | Observe thermal profile mimicry if system is active for >5 seconds |
| **EM Field Meter** | Capable of detecting RF or ELF | Detect field propagation, phase drift, and resonance lock zones |
| **SEM / AFM Access (Optional)** | Academic lab required | Optional for post-test lattice analysis of aluminum foil under harmonic imprint |

## 🧠 Summary

All materials are legal, publicly available, and not subject to export restriction. Total system cost ranges from **$80–$200 USD**, depending on availability of gold ring and whether optional THz equipment is used.

The core functionality can be demonstrated without THz injection — only the harmonic phase triad and pure materials are necessary to observe surface response shift.
