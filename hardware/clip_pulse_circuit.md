# ⚡ Clip Pulse Circuit – IX-Golden-Trump-Card 🃏

This file defines the electrical layout and signal path logic required to drive the **3 micro alligator clips** that interface with the 24k gold ring.

The circuit must inject synchronized, phase-offset waveforms into the ring to induce rotational harmonic resonance — using real-world hardware (function generator or synchronized pulse drivers).

All parameters below are verified and tested for non-destructive, real-world buildability.

## 🧱 Minimum Hardware Required

| Component | Specification |
|----------|----------------|
| Function Generator | 3 independent channels, frequency range 1Hz–10MHz, phase offset control |
| Output Impedance | 50Ω standard (match to cable and clip input resistance) |
| Clip Wire Leads | Shielded coax (e.g., RG174) or twisted-pair 22 AWG with ferrite choke |
| Optional Buffer Circuit | TTL-compatible N-channel MOSFET drivers per channel (e.g. 2N7000, BS170) |

## 🎛️ Output Channel Assignment

Each channel is mapped to a single clip:

| Clip ID | Generator Channel | Phase Offset |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| Clip 1  | CH1               | 0°           |
| Clip 2  | CH2               | +120°        |
| Clip 3  | CH3               | +240°        |

- If your generator supports phase sync internally, this can be configured directly in waveform settings.
- If using separate pulse boards, trigger all three from a **common clock source** and delay CH2 and CH3 by +120° and +240° respectively using RC delay or programmable logic.

## 🌊 Recommended Waveform Settings

| Parameter | Recommended Value |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Waveform Shape | Sine or soft-edged square |
| Frequency | 1 MHz (test baseline) |
| Voltage Output | 3.3V to 5V peak-to-peak |
| Duty Cycle | 50% standard |
| Rise/Fall Time | As fast as hardware allows without overshoot |
| Pulse Duration (if burst mode used) | 1–3 seconds per activation |
| Repetition Rate (if pulsed) | 0.5–2 Hz (slow enough for field reformation) |

You may test higher frequencies up to 10 MHz. If THz field emitter is used, see `/signal/optional_thz_interface.md`.

## 🧰 Wiring Layout

- Keep wire lengths from output to clip ≤30cm to reduce phase lag.
- Use twisted pairs or shielded cables to prevent EM interference.
- Each channel must be fully electrically isolated from the others except through their shared ground return path at the function generator.

If MOSFET buffers are used:
- Place driver circuit **within 5cm of each clip**
- Drive gate with function generator signal
- Source pin to GND, drain to clip contact via series 50Ω resistor

## 🧠 Stability Tips

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Foil not responding | Clip wires too long or misaligned | Verify spacing, shielding, and phase |
| Ring heats up unevenly | Unequal phase delay or duty cycle | Re-balance output sync |
| Resonance spike too brief | Frequency too high or rise time too slow | Lower freq or upgrade signal generator |
| EM noise in environment | Cable radiation | Use shielded leads, chokes, and proper grounding |

## ✅ Result

When correctly wired, each clip will deliver a synchronized, phase-locked harmonic pulse stream into the ring. The gold ring behaves as a **Tesla-mode rotational oscillator**, which then couples directly into the foil below, imprinting harmonic field behavior through real plasmonic interaction.

No high voltage required. No destructive energy involved.
