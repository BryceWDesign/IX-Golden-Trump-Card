# 🧽 Aluminum Foil Preparation Guide – IX-Golden-Trump-Card 🃏

This guide outlines the critical handling, cleaning, and mounting procedures for preparing the aluminum foil substrate in the IX-Golden-Trump-Card 🃏 system.

The foil acts as the **field-responsive medium**. Any contamination, wrinkling, or improper grounding can suppress the gold-mimicking behavior and prevent correct harmonic entrainment.

## 📏 Material Specification Recap

- Material: Aluminum (Reynolds Wrap or equivalent)
- Dimensions: 30.5 cm × 30.5 cm (1 ft²)
- Thickness: ~15–18 microns (μm)
- Type: **Standard non-coated, non-stick-free foil only**
  - *Do not use non-stick foil (e.g., "easy release") — it has a plastic/polymer barrier*

---

## 🧤 Handling Procedures

- Always use **anti-static gloves** or **tweezers** to prevent:
  - Finger oils
  - Static discharge
  - Microabrasion

- Remove a single sheet from roll without folding or crumpling.
- If the sheet has factory crimping or edge curl, trim outer edge with clean scissors.
- Do **not polish** or abrade the surface — micro-surface variation is used by the system.

## 🧼 Surface Purity Cleaning (Optional but Recommended)

If working in high-humidity or dust-prone environments:

1. Place foil flat on clean, non-conductive work surface.
2. Spray lightly with **99% isopropyl alcohol** from ≥30 cm away.
3. Gently drag a dry, clean microfiber cloth **in one direction only** (no circular wiping).
4. Let air-dry completely — do **not** wipe dry or heat-dry.

⚠️ Never use soaps, abrasives, ammonia-based cleaners, or ultrasonic baths — they disrupt the surface layer and affect field propagation.

## ⚙️ Mounting on Non-Conductive Base

1. Center the cleaned foil sheet on your **non-metallic base** (acrylic, wood, ceramic).
2. Optionally secure corners with **small tabs of Kapton or non-conductive tape** (~5mm max width).
3. Ensure foil remains:
   - Flat (no warps)
   - Tensioned but not stretched
   - Not in contact with any metal or conductive surface other than the designed clips

---

## 🔩 Clip Contact Zones

- The 4 corner alligator clips should bite ~5mm inward from the corners.
- The foil must **not be pierced or torn** during clip attachment.
- Test resistance across the surface — values should be under 1Ω between corner points.

If resistance exceeds 5Ω, re-clean or replace the foil — oxide or micro-contamination may be present.

---

## 🧲 Central Ring Area

- Do not mark or indent the foil center — alignment is visual.
- Once the gold ring is placed, **avoid lifting or sliding it**.
- All 3 micro-clips must simultaneously touch:
  - The ring’s outer circumference
  - The foil’s top surface within 1mm of ring’s inner boundary

## 🧠 Notes for Field Stability

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Flat, clean, uncontaminated foil | Enables maximum phase retention |
| Wrinkled or folded surface | Field loss, phase noise, signal damping |
| Humidity above 65% | Reduced dielectric stability, possible corona effects |
| Foil in contact with metal surface | Field cancellation, signal bleed, entrainment failure |

---

## ✅ Result

Once prepped and mounted, the foil behaves as a **field-mutable resonance substrate**, capable of receiving the vibrational and electromagnetic field signature from the 24k gold ring.

With proper clip and signal injection, the foil will begin to mimic key gold surface behaviors without chemical change.

Proceed to `/hardware/clip_pulse_circuit.md` to configure the signal path for injection.
